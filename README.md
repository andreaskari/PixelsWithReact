# PixelsWithReact

Created by Andre Askarinam over Winter Break 2016-2017.

## Description

This is a basic small picture editor created completely with React.js on top of a Flask API that takes stored `png` photos and returns their pixel matrices if requested. All the code is open-sourced and available at your disposal.

## Future Possible Additions

As of right now there is limited support and functionality (due to lack of applicability of this small editor). This is mainly a showcase, but can be extended in the future to suit the following features:
- Import/Export of photos
- Better selection tools
    + Dragging via "Pixel Selector" tool
    + Laso tool
-  Zoom in/out of photos
